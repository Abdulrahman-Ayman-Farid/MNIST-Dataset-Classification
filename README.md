# MNIST-Dataset-Classification
Overview
This Jupyter notebook demonstrates a workflow for classifying handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset using two different machine learning models: Logistic Regression and a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The notebook covers data loading, preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and comparison of the two models.

The MNIST dataset is a collection of 70,000 grayscale images of handwritten digits (0-9). Each image is 28x28 pixels. The goal of this notebook is to classify these digits using two different models: Logistic Regression and a CNN. The notebook also includes data preprocessing, visualization, and model evaluation steps.
